// TODO: 27/10/2019 - Rupesh/Arpit/Harshit's straddle strategies - Extra focus on risk mgmt aspects

sell atm (redundant) straddle (based on the CMP)

	 - sell call + sell put

+/- 2 in the option chain - add 2 straddles on each side

portfolio = 5 straddles

Up-move -> cut lower range and add higher range straddles so as to ensure that the portfolio always consists of ~5 straddles

Down-move

In case of sharp moves -
    - stop loss triggered

    20K -> 40K
        - Volatility levels - completely unknown - act in time - Arpit's focus was on this point - current requirement
        - Stop loss does not have any breathing space - definitely the case

/* TODO: 27/10/2019 - Find the answer to this question. */
    - Can IV be used? Should it be used?

Program (At any point in time):
    - Market Analysis (Identifies opportunities) + Risk Analysis (Protects your captial)
    - Trades placed

We have a portfolio
    - Market Analysis (Slows down - Look for squaring off opportunities) + Risk Analysis (Continued - IV monitoring) - ??


    {p1, p2, p3, p4, p5} -> long INFY ->
    Steps:
    - p1 - 1 million simulations -  -
    - p2 - 1 million
    - p3 -
    ...
    How will each simulation affect my portfolio?
    After all possibilities are collected, I take out the worst possible 5% scenarios - 95%


    Output - tomorrow we are 89% confident that we will loose no more than 15% of our overall captial

Machine learning

    - Training + Prediction

    Training - ?? Y = mX + c - m, c - values - 3 months (July-Oct) data m = 0.2 c = -0.75
    Apr - June -> y (90% accurate) = x, m and c

    Train once, use forever - this never works
    28th Oct - use same values
    29th Oct - use same values
    30th Oct - use same values

    Train weekly
    25th July - 25th Oct - Trained - m = 0.2, c = -0.75
    1st August - 1st November - m = 0.24 , c = -0.65
    8th AUgust - 8th November -

    Train Daily..?

    Real-time training (Continuous learning) + prediction
    25th July - 25th Oct - Trained - m = 0.2, c = -0.75 - Use minute-by-minute data to train for the first time
    9th Nov - 10:00:05 AM - data - Train -> m, c values find out and then predict y based on the new values
